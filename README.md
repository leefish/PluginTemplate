About
==============

PluginTemplate was originally a personal template for creating MyBB plugins but I thought I may as well push it to github. It makes it easier for me to access it across machines this way too.

Installation
==============

Clone the whole repo into your development root:

    git clone https://github.com/euantor/PluginTemplate.git

Then simple change the folder's name to suit your plugin and start modifying as you need to.
